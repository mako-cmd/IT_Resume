I continuously engage in challenging projects in order to develop new skills while keeping the skills I have obtained as a developer sharp. I am currently working with a mentor who regularly assigns me projects to improve my problem solving skills. Most recently, I developed a system that can detect the position of a sound source in one dimensional space. In the next few weeks we will be expanding this project to work in three dimensional space. Additionally, I am currently teaching myself web development, and will soon have mastered HTML and CSS.
